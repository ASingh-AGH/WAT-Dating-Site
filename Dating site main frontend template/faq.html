						Cherii has a special feature where the messages disappear after reaching the chat limit of 10 messages. This is to encourage user privacy and spontaneity, encouraging you to focus on your most promising matches. There is no way to retrive these messages.

						Another reason why your chat may disappear is that the other person has deleted their account or unmatched you. 

						Additionally, you can also manualy delete chats that you are not interested in by clicking on the unmatch button next to the profile.
